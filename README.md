# Pricing_ML

**Pricing_ML** builds on the existing [Pricing repository](https://github.com/rimchmielowitz/Pricing) and extends its logic with **Machine Learning** components. The base concept remains the same: customer tasks (orders) are matched with potential drivers (ODs), and a dynamic pricing mechanism determines individual prices based on **Willingness to Pay (WTP)** and **Expectation to be Paid (ETP)**.

## ðŸ”— Mathematical Model Reference

The mathematical formulation of the pricing model â€” including all constraints, objectives, and variables â€” is fully documented in the original [Pricing repository](https://github.com/rimchmielowitz/Pricing).  
This repository focuses **only** on the **integration of ML** to replace the stochastic elements (random WTP/ETP values) with **data-driven predictions**.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

- `Pricing_ML.ipynb`: Main notebook (Google Colab compatible), which includes:
  - ML-based estimation of WTP and ETP using **Bayesian Regression** (via [Pyro](https://pypi.org/project/pyro-ppl/))
  - Integration of predicted WTP/ETP values into a **Mixed Integer Programming** model using [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)
  - Visualization & analysis of results (e.g., routes, Gantt charts, distance comparisons)

- Supporting functions for:
  - Instance loading and preparation
  - ML model training
  - Optimization model setup and solving
  - Result aggregation and plotting

## ðŸš€ How to Use

[ðŸ‘‰ Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rimchmielowitz/Pricing_ML/blob/main/Pricing_ML.ipynb)

Simply run the notebook.  
All required packages will be installed automatically, and example data is already included. No manual setup or data upload needed.

## ðŸ“Š ML vs. Randomized Approach

The bar chart below compares total driving distances using the **ML-based method** vs. the **randomized method** across different SPL-DMD levels (driver-to-order ratios). Each scenario contains 10 orders.

- **Gray area**: Total baseline distance (drivers traveling from their start to end node without fulfilling orders)
- **Orange area**: Additional detour distance with **randomized WTP/ETP**
- **Blue area**: Additional detour distance with **ML-predicted WTP/ETP**

> From a ratio of 1.2 drivers per task onward, detour distances are reduced by up to **35.76%** using the ML method compared to random values.

This demonstrates how machine learning can significantly improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary kilometers in task assignment.

## âœ… Summary

- **Improved efficiency** through smarter WTP and ETP predictions
- **Seamless integration** with the existing pricing logic and optimization model
- **No manual setup required** â€“ just open the notebook and run
